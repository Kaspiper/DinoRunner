This game was a semester-long project done for Fundamentals of Engineering (ENGR 1181) at the Ohio State University. 
This is a replication of the Dino Runner game built into Google Chrome to entertain you when internet connection is lost.
By working on this project, I learned how to program in Matlab, as well as how to create and use sprite sheets for animation and game dev.
